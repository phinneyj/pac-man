    <p>Pac-Man[a], stylized in all capitals as PAC-MAN, is an arcade game designed by Toru Iwatani of Namco, and first released in Japan as Puck Man in May 1980.[2][3] Licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway Games, it was released in October 1980 when the top arcade games were stark space shooters, such as Galaxian and Asteroids. Pac-Man established the conventions of the maze chase genre,[6] and is considered one of the classics in video game history and an icon of 1980s popular culture.[7][8][9][10] There may have been a gender divide among players in these genres; according to one estimate published in 1982, 60% of Pac-Man players were women, while 90% of those playing space shoot-'em-up Omega Race were men.[11]</p>
    <p>Pac-man is one of the highest-grossing video games of all time,[12] having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[13][14] Adjusted for inflation, all versions of Pac-Man are estimated to have grossed over $12 billion in total revenue.[15] The game and subsequent entries in the series became a social phenomenon that crossed over to other media,[16] such as the Pac-Man animated television series in 1982 and the top-ten Buckner and Garcia single "Pac-Man Fever" in 1981.[17]</p>        
    <p>Dozens of similarly styled maze games appeared over the next several years, with some becoming successful in their own right. The namesake character has appeared in more than 30 officially licensed game spin-offs,[18] not to mention bootleg versions.[19][20] According to the Davie-Brown Index, the Pac-Man character has the highest brand awareness of any video game character among American consumers, with 94% recognition.[21] The Pac-Man franchise is one of the longest-running video game franchises from the golden age of arcade games. In 2010, the Google Doodle version was estimated to have been played by over 1 billion people worldwide.[22] Pac-Man is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.,[23] and New York's Museum of Modern Art.[24</p>
